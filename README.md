# To-Do List Web App

A simple to-do list web app that allows users to manage their tasks with an intuitive interface. This project demonstrates the basics of DOM manipulation with vanilla JavaScript.

## Features
- **Add Tasks**: Add tasks to your to-do list by clicking the "Add Task" button or pressing the "Enter" key.
- **Delete Tasks**: Click the trash icon next to each task to delete it.
- **Responsive**: Works on desktop and mobile devices.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: For structuring the app.
- **CSS**: For styling the app, including a minimalist design.
- **JavaScript**: For the interactivity (task management).
- **Font Awesome**: For the trash icon button.

## Installation
To get started with the To-Do List Web app:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/To-Do-List-Web.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd To-Do-List-Web
   ```

3. Open `index.html` in your browser.

## How It Works
- Tasks are added by typing in the input box and either clicking the "Add Task" button or pressing "Enter".
- Tasks are displayed in an unordered list, and each task has a delete button (with a trash icon).
- Clicking the delete button will remove the task from the list.
